** What is karat
   A karat, when used with gold, is a unit of purity-- 24-karat gold is pure gold, 
   but usually you mix gold with a metal like copper or silver to make jewelry
   (because pure gold is too soft). Each karat indicates 1/24th of the whole. 
   So if a piece of jewelry is made of metal that is 18 parts gold and 6 parts
   copper, that is 18-karat gold.
